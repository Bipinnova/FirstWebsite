        <h1>Ergonomic Assessment</h1>
        <hr>
        <P>
            An ergonomic assessment is an assessment of a worker at their workstation to ensure correct working postures and workstation set-up
            . A good ergonomic assessment is done to reduce a worker's exposure to physical hazards such as:
            Uncomfortable postures. Repetitive tasks. Straining of the body.
